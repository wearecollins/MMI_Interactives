- Open Webserver/static/share/config.json
  - Edit "diskPath": The _absolute path_ to the 'media' folder managed by the [Sync](https://github.com/wearecollins/MMI_Interactives/Sync) service
  - Edit "shareServer": The _URL_ to the [Sharing service](https://github.com/wearecollins/MMI_Interactives/Sharing)

# Running
The station this instance is hosting is passed in via a _--station_ parameter.

* `npm start -- --station [STATION]` where _[STATION]_ is one of `share`, `anythingmuppets`, or `performance`
  - yes, there is an extra `--` when running via _npm_
  - without npm: `node server.js --station [STATION]`
* open frontend
  - if using the [Frontend App](../Frontend/), just run that app and it will load the webpage.
  - otherwise, start up the [Camera App](../Camera/) and open your browser to [http://localhost:8080/?stream=true]()
